summary: "This book's sole purpose is to be depressing. 7/10"
---

- sad
- just really really sad
- MC learned a good lesson when he talked to the bully in the hospital - obviously it was never about his lazy eye, but when you're being bullied it probably feels good to be able to blame something for it.
- I wanted to like the relationship between MC and Kojima but the foundation of their relationship was just too toxic. Shared suffering isn't enough to be happy together.
- I don't like bullying stories. They're too depressing. I also have a hard to relating to them because my life has been pretty fine so far, and I'm not capable of empathizing with the pain of being bullied.
