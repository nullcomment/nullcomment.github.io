summary: "Cute funny parts were good. Serious drama parts were bad. 6/10"

- Yappi!
- Comedic parts are much much stronger than the serious parts.
- Algard is an idiot and his entire plotline was annoying. I don't think the show did enough to show him breaking under his imposter syndrome and inferiority complex toward Anis. He turns into a rebel way too fast to take seriously.
- Ilia cute. Too bad the show didn't show her backstory or anything so ends up just being a maid with overwhelming loyalty. Would've been cool to see what Anis did to deserve that (maybe I forgot)
- Lainie felt like an afterthought to shoehorn in Algard's plan to become a vampire. I don't see how Al would've known she's a vampire to concoct this whole plan around her.
- The parents of Anis and Euphy were a little too understanding and chill. I respect the choice to go against the grain and do something different from "cold royal parents have high expectations and treat their kids like pawns" but Anis and Euphy's parents were so understanding that it was hard to believe they were royalty at all.
- The art in the dragon fight as well as the duel in the last episode was really pretty. Especially the final duel where Euphy does her spirit contract thing. Rainbows and fairies pretty. Arc-en-ciel is a really cool and elegant looking sword.
- In contrast, the visuals for the Al vs Anis fight was horrendous. Too much naruto running. I also dislike the look of Anis's dual swords overall - they look far too much like toys with their wide laser-beam looking blades.
- The noble party was too comically evil to take seriously.
- The romance was cute and fine, but it didn't feel very believable. It also didn't feel like Anis and Euphy did much together after the dragon fight. A good contrast to this is Lycoris Recoil where Chisato/Takina's relationship felt way deeper, despite the show not actually explicitly stating any romance.
- Overall, first half was a 8/10 and last half was a 5/10. Comedy was far better than the drama.
