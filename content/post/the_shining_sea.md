summary: "Extremely well written but weak story. 6/10"
---

- Incredibly personal story about Sayuri and Yoichi
- Side characters were a little weak but they served their purpose well enough.
    - Mochizuki and Akiko storyline... confuses me. Not sure what the point was other than showcasing them being unfaithful and also being flawed.
    - Takeshi was weird for being in love with Sayuri, but luckily the other characters are aware of this. He only really existed to push the plot forward, nothing else interesting about him.
        - He did have a really good line that I liked though! He said something along the lines of "It's okay to ask other people for help, they mind a lot less than I thought they would". Good life lesson, too bad I'll never take it to heart and continue soloing all my problems :(
- Ending was a bit abrupt, and also makes Yoichi an undeserving savior.
    - I understand that Sayuri is mentally out, but I don't totally like how the only reason she's able to function again is because the man that abandoned her came back. I think some other trigger would've been nicer, like seeing her own child.
- Overall a pretty weak story. Very well and intimately written, but the mystery wasn't really solved. It was just told to us. 6/10
