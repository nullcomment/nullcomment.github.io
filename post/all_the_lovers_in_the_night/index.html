Fuyuko meets a guy, falls in love, and they drift apart before anything substantive happens. So instead of writing down my thoughts on the book, I&rsquo;ll use the book&rsquo;s plot points to write about myself, and the things this book made me think about. I&rsquo;ve always had these thoughts, but this book was a convenient combination of all my fears, likes, and dislikes, so I figured I&rsquo;d take the chance to write something more than just a review. If you know who I am, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m fine - but this essay is going to be <em>really</em> cringe.</li><li>Fuyuko and I are not very similar. In fact, the only thing we really share is our antisocial-ness. I&rsquo;m not very satisfied with my antisocialness, but Fuyuko at the beginning seems to embrace it. It&rsquo;s only until she meets xxx that she changes this behavior, though she&rsquo;s too scared to do it sober. I&rsquo;m the opposite - I wanna vomit my thoughts toward something. I wanna vent about mean customers at work, or about racist strangers being weird, or about an how an anime I&rsquo;m watching had a dumb plot progression. I wanna fangirl about cute new FFXIV outfits, or about cool video game moments, or about how I wish asian artists would do tours in the US. But that would require initiating conversation, because how would anyone else know what I&rsquo;m thinking? It&rsquo;s so much easier to walk past and stick my earbuds in, so&mldr; I don&rsquo;t. And I think about these things instead, and write them down. Fuyuko solves this problem by being drunk, but thats probably not that play for me.</li><li>My social anxiety might sound really depressing, but I truly believe I&rsquo;m not actually depressed. Trust me bro. Some days are obviously a bit worse than others, though - I take my pick of imposter syndrome, loneliness, and existential dread. Every once in awhile, I wonder what I&rsquo;ll be doing in 5 years, or 10 years. Will I have a partner? Will working in tech be fulfilling enough to last me until retirement? Will I pivot at some point? If working for less than a year has me going through the classic mid life crisis, will I even last until I&rsquo;m actually middle aged? These aren&rsquo;t unique struggles, but they&rsquo;re certainly still worth thinking about. Auto-piloting through life is not something I want to do again - I did that in my last two years of college, and frankly (outside of some exceptions), those years basically didn&rsquo;t exist for me.</li><li>While I&rsquo;m on the topic of depression, I&rsquo;ll bring up another &ldquo;trait&rdquo; of mine that a number of my friends and coworkers have picked up on, that I&rsquo;ve (unfortunately) reinforced. &ldquo;I like depressing stories&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with the statement as-is, but the generalization is mostly true. Depressing stories, to me, feel more substantive in the emotions and relationships portrayed. I&rsquo;d chalk this preference up to an easy life. No deaths, no household drama, no huge hurdles to overcome. My life has been pretty good. If I were to rephrase it more negatively, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve had a pretty boring life. Tragic stories with a lot of introspection are particularly good at captivating me, because the introspection leads me to emotions I&rsquo;ve never really felt elsewhere. So I don&rsquo;t think I like depressing stories. Rather, the stories I like are usually depressing. Pretty cringe of me, but I like what I like.</li><li>I&rsquo;ll take this chance to jump topics and genres - this time, to one that <em>All the Lovers in the Night</em> dances around. I&rsquo;m a bit conflicted about whether this book counts as romance, but there is a one sided crush, so it&rsquo;s probably one. I read a lot of romance, but I don&rsquo;t really like watching romance stories (especially Anime). Anime tends to portray characters younger-looking, which I really dislike. While reading I can imagine characters older, which is probably why I prefer novels for this genre. I tend to stay away from romcoms, but I also stay away from stories with a bit too much drama. My taste in romance is very bland. I like when there&rsquo;s a single couple from the start, with some problems to get through together, and an optimistic ending. A simple wish fulfilment plot. It&rsquo;d be nice if everything was as easy as that.</li><li>The last chapter might be my favorite ending of a book ever. No clear cut conclusion, no shocking revelations, no deep lessons learned. Fuyuko writes a single phrase in a notebook - <em>All the Lovers in the Night</em>. I can imagine a lot of people being disappointed by the ending. It&rsquo;s a rather shallow title drop with not much meaning behind it, preceded by an inconclusive end to Fuyoko&rsquo;s new relationship. I loved it. I&rsquo;ve always had a liking for short, vaguely thought-provoking phrases. Many of <em>Yoru Sumino</em>&rsquo;s novel titles hit that special itch of mine: <em>I Will Forget This Feeling Someday</em>, or <em>I Had That Same Dream Again</em>. They&rsquo;re not quotes, and not fully formed ideas - just short phrases that inspire the reader to wonder where the train of thought is headed. I use one such phrase quite often as a profile description - <em>sometimes i wonder</em>. Every once in a while, I&rsquo;ll get asked what it means - &ldquo;what are you wondering about?&rdquo; - but there really isn&rsquo;t any more to it. Finishing the sentence would ruin it.</li></ul></div></article><div class=post-comment data-comment=utterances><span class=post-comment-notloaded><i class="iconfont icon-chatbox-ellipses-sharp"></i>&nbsp;Load comments</span>
