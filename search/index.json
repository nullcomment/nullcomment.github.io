[{"content":" sad just really really sad MC learned a good lesson when he talked to the bully in the hospital - obviously it was never about his lazy eye, but when you\u0026rsquo;re being bullied it probably feels good to be able to blame something for it. I wanted to like the relationship between MC and Kojima but the foundation of their relationship was just too toxic. Shared suffering isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to be happy together. I don\u0026rsquo;t like bullying stories. They\u0026rsquo;re too depressing. I also have a hard to relating to them because my life has been pretty fine so far, and I\u0026rsquo;m not capable of empathizing with the pain of being bullied.

Other people have analyzed this book\u0026rsquo;s morals in much more eloquent ways, so all I have to add is that it\u0026rsquo;s interesting how the Artificial Friends in this book generate their own ideologies and religion. Klara\u0026rsquo;s misunderstanding of the power of the Sun is a very interesting and recurring theme. First, Klara\u0026rsquo;s reverence for the Sun clearly manifested \u0026ldquo;risky emergent behavior\u0026rdquo; - she planned the destruction of public infrastructure because she believed it followed her own instructions. Seems like a clear precursor to other AI stories where robots \u0026ldquo;following their programming\u0026rdquo; do terrible and horrible things. Josie won the lottery for lifting (a procedure that makes children much smarter, at the cost of possibly killing them), but I can only assume that it was coincidence - obviously from the point of view of Klara, the Sun answered her prayers and saved Josie, but from \u0026ldquo;our\u0026rdquo; human perspective the Sun isn\u0026rsquo;t able to do that. What other things do we believe in, as humans, that a higher or more advanced civilization would lightly dismiss? On the flip side - what makes Klara\u0026rsquo;s beliefs wrong if it worked? Klara believes that the Sun cured Josie. She prayed for help and the Sun did so. That makes no sense to me, so I go \u0026ldquo;oh it was just a coincidence she got better.\u0026rdquo; But maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a metaphor that I miss with that train of thought. Very interesting twist halfway through that was properly foreshadowed right from the beginning - nicely done! Klara was bought to replace Josie in case the real Josie died. This is why Mother was so interested in Klara\u0026rsquo;s observation skills, and wanted Klara to \u0026ldquo;walk like Josie\u0026rdquo; right at the start, to see if Klara was capable of imitating Josie well. If Klara can imitate Josie completely, to the point where her own mother can buy into the lie, what\u0026rsquo;s so special about humanity? Not that much, I guess. We place higher importance on human experiences not because they are intrinsically more valuable but because humanity shares the experience of being human. The slow fade at the end - clearly AFs don\u0026rsquo;t last forever, and their memories and physical functions deteriorate over time until they die. Mother and Josie clearly care a lot for Klara, but It seems to me to be more of a pet-like way - letting their pet \u0026ldquo;slow fade\u0026rdquo; with dignity, rather than be dissected for science. Everyone knew the slow fade was going to happen. Why would Mother want Klara to replace Josie if she knew even Klara wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last 10-15 years? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t she have to go through that death again? I guess she was just desperate for temporary comfort.

Mochizuki and Akiko storyline\u0026hellip; confuses me. Not sure what the point was other than showcasing them being unfaithful and also being flawed. Takeshi was weird for being in love with Sayuri, but luckily the other characters are aware of this. He only really existed to push the plot forward, nothing else interesting about him. He did have a really good line that I liked though! He said something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay to ask other people for help, they mind a lot less than I thought they would\u0026rdquo;. Good life lesson, too bad I\u0026rsquo;ll never take it to heart and continue soloing all my problems :( Ending was a bit abrupt, and also makes Yoichi an undeserving savior. I understand that Sayuri is mentally out, but I don\u0026rsquo;t totally like how the only reason she\u0026rsquo;s able to function again is because the man that abandoned her came back. I think some other trigger would\u0026rsquo;ve been nicer, like seeing her own child. Overall a pretty weak story. Very well and intimately written, but the mystery wasn\u0026rsquo;t really solved. It was just told to us. 6/10 ","date":"2023-05-25","permalink":"https://nullcomment.github.io/post/the_shining_sea/","tags":["novel"],"title":"The Shining Sea"},{"content":" Very cool narrative structure. Kanae, the main character, experiences the week that the story takes place in backwards - he lives through Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, etc in that order. This leads to some interesting situations where other characters have more information than Kanae about the mystery that is happening, because the past him has more info than the current him. The romance is fine. They\u0026rsquo;re cute together and the interludes from Akari\u0026rsquo;s POV were solid glimpses into the life that the MC \u0026ldquo;abandoned\u0026rdquo; when he went to Tokyo. The twist was foreshadowed pretty early on. I personally think the foreshadowing was a bit too heavy - I think a bit less would\u0026rsquo;ve made the impact of the realization a lot more memorable. I like how the MC has to deal with the disconnect between his mental image of Akito and the reality - reminds me of how easy it is to idealize someone in your head, regardless of if its romantic or a childhood hero. The rooftop suicide threat scene was a bit confusing. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure Akari\u0026rsquo;s motivations for suicide were properly foreshadowed. With that being said, I do understand that she was saving all her money to get off the island, so when Akito steals it all on top of continuing to abuse her, it probably is enough to contemplate escaping. Maybe I just have too privileged a life to understand feeling like everything has fallen apart. MC\u0026rsquo;s reaction to the suicide scene was great though. The absolute panic and desperation was very moving, and I liked the way he talked Akari out of it. It would\u0026rsquo;ve felt really cheap and unrealistic if he just said some magic words to fix and reassure her about everything. The fact that he\u0026rsquo;s in total panic, babbling whatever he thinks might work feels more realistic to me, and I think is maybe a much more genuine way to convince someone suicidal that they matter. Hospital scene was pretty good. loser bitch Akito can go cry in his bed because he\u0026rsquo;s such a huge loser of a brother. I\u0026rsquo;m glad MC went ahead and verbally abused the hospital patient who almost died, because he 100% deserves it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I understand why Hayase immediately started taking care of him, considering that they were supposedly broken up for awhile, but wtf do I know about relationships. He was an asshole for so long but I guess that happens in real life too. The lottery thing was a funny thing to end on. Get it twisted, you will win.

This makes the book\u0026rsquo;s structure mirror Kaya\u0026rsquo;s emotional attachment to Chika - it basically represents his obsession over his first love and how he can\u0026rsquo;t let go. Yoru Sumino\u0026rsquo;s longest book by far, which is a bit conflicting because of how little happens. A lot of the book is extremely detailed description of Kaya and Chika\u0026rsquo;s dialogue and interactions at the bus stop. It\u0026rsquo;s almost poetic how the book gets you attached to this duo through their interactions, only to have you finish the book and barely remember what exactly they talked about. Even having binged it in a day, I can only recall one or two actual conversations they had, despite the first 70% of the book being almost entirely their dialogue. Because of how strangely poetic the narrative was, despite it not really being that compelling of a story, the book made me really start thinking about interpersonal relationships and our connections with each other. The characters aren\u0026rsquo;t great, but I think it was clear that they weren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily supposed to be likeable. Kaya is a huge narcissist who is desperate to feel special, while Chika is this idealized entity that we only get to interact with through Kaya. Kaya clings to his memory of Chika years later, which is pretty understandable given how close he got to \u0026ldquo;feeling special\u0026rdquo; with her and the supernatural phenomenon that surrounds their meetings. Sunou Sanae is a decent foil to Kaya. I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sold on the romance between them, although honestly thats exactly what Kaya felt for most of the time as well so it works out. I loved her conversations with Kaya while she broke down his shell and ego. Both satisfying and heart wrenching, because as a reader I developed fondness and intrigue for Chika and her world. The meeting between Kaya and Aki (the lyricist who wrote Silhouette) was also really nice. I\u0026rsquo;m glad the author didn\u0026rsquo;t shoehorn some kind of sappy meeting between them, and kept it down to earth and small-talky. The single out-of-place line, \u0026ldquo;I pray we both are happy\u0026rdquo; edges just close enough to that sappy line without crossing it, and I really liked the delivery. The book is a very emotional one, rather than a narrative one. I read it empathizing with the characters and what they\u0026rsquo;re feeling, rather than being sucked in by a compelling narrative (which there wasn\u0026rsquo;t). I think if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a good story, this book isn\u0026rsquo;t it. But if you\u0026rsquo;re open to getting immersed in a story and emotions of a character, this book is a solid, though provoking trip into Kaya\u0026rsquo;s life. On a personal note, man I envy Kaya and Chika\u0026rsquo;s relationship in the beginning of the novel. I feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t get truly invested in most romance stories because I\u0026rsquo;m not able to buy into the love. Some examples off the top of my head include Kaguya-sama and No Game No Life Zero, where the romance is predetermined and doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually develop. I think this is mostly due to the amount of dialogue - most stories wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dedicate such a huge part of their time solely toward dialogue. In some ways, its a waste of time - a few good scenes are enough to convince the audience that two characters are in love. But in this case, dedicating 270 pages solely to dialogue between Kaya and Chika was a daring masterstroke. Reading it feels like watching a visceral, deep human connection and god damn I want to know what that\u0026rsquo;s like.

Happy ending was sorta cheesy but still really nice. The music is really good, enough for me to ignore my usual distaste of sawano\u0026rsquo;s engrish The story was surprisingly unique and had feels in a way that I was totally caught off guard by. The dynamic of the \u0026ldquo;oppressor\u0026rdquo; (Lena as their commander) being the one who was left behind at the end of Part 1 felt pretty meaningful. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the narrative decision to pivot from the Republic/Lena and follow Spearhead into the federacy was the best one. The end of Part 1 felt like the perfect ending for the last five members of Spearheard. Free from their servitude, free from their burdens, and free from Lena, their oppressor, even if she was a humane one. I guess I was just hoping for a different story than what the author was telling. DESPITE the previous bullet point, I do think it was a bold and pretty cool move for the story to abandon Lena and follow spearhead. I wish we got to see more of Lena\u0026rsquo;s growth rather than a single flashback scene + timeskip, but I also appreciated seeing Spearhead never adjusting to normal life and not willing to accept simply chilling out. I think a lot of stories would\u0026rsquo;ve tried to show soldiers getting over their ptsd/attachedment to the battlefield, but 86 went all in on everyone\u0026rsquo;s goals and determination to \u0026ldquo;reach the end\u0026rdquo; which I like. Typically I\u0026rsquo;d say that war is never good and stories glorifying war are out of touch, but with 86 I\u0026rsquo;m fine with it specifically because the enemy is an autonomous army - it\u0026rsquo;s not humans killing each other, but uniting against a common inhuman enemy. Lena being called \u0026ldquo;Queen\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Bloody Regina\u0026rdquo; in Part 2 is cringe. There should\u0026rsquo;ve been a more subtle way to represent her character growth. I think her streak of red hair was enough - badass but not over the top. That and her demonstrated ability to navigate military politics are enough to show her growth. Not a fan of Frederica - I get that she\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be a parallel to Shin but I think her voice annoyed me a bit too much for me to like her. I also don\u0026rsquo;t like her magical eyes that can see the past/future - felt like such a random and unnecessary power that never really affected the plot. Shin\u0026rsquo;s anger when he thought he was being left behind was mega feels. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t like how quickly they \u0026ldquo;killed\u0026rdquo; the other members of Spearhead. Giving us a bit more time to come to terms with their death before they did in the next one would\u0026rsquo;ve made their \u0026ldquo;deaths\u0026rdquo; hit far harder.

If I ignore that then the main pair was pretty cute. After watching so much Anime this is pretty easy :| The worm is\u0026hellip; kinda phallic. I wish the monster had a different design or texture to reduce that feeling. Soundtrack top tier as always. ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-ru-. Main theme Suzume is great, and actually feels different from RADWIMPS\u0026rsquo;s other works. I\u0026rsquo;m sad it wasn\u0026rsquo;t totally used in the movie (I think it was a simplified remix). Sky over Tokyo captures the mystical feeling of impending doom really well - it was super well utilized during the Tokyo scenes. Closing the Door is a slow orchestral version of the main theme, but damn it hits just right, both standalone and during the movie scene it\u0026rsquo;s used. Tamaki wasn\u0026rsquo;t used in the movie itself, but despite its simplicity its a nice listen and its cool to have a dedicated song for Tamaki\u0026rsquo;s feelings. Visuals are also top tier, as always. I\u0026rsquo;m a slut for starscapes and the Ever-After\u0026rsquo;s starry sky and mystical vibe fulfils that fantasy perfectly. I also purposely took the time during the movie to look at the backgrounds and foregrounds of certain shots instead of focusing on the character (specifically young-Suzume while she was wandering the Ever After). Stepmom and mom are both based. Backstory is tragic but Suzume is really cool. The \u0026ldquo;parent died and family takes over as parental figure\u0026rdquo; backstory is relatively common and while this movie didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything special in that front, it was still well executed. Suzume\u0026rsquo;s initial journey from Kyushu to Ehime to Kobe was really fun to watch. It was pretty exciting when I realized the duo weren\u0026rsquo;t going to go back to Kyushu. The living chair was dumb in a fun way, and carried the comedy. It was also cute to watch Suzume meet new helpful people (Suzume and Chika girl-talking at night was cute, and babysitting Rumi\u0026rsquo;s kids was also comedic with the chair adding to the chaos). The Tokyo boss fight was very cool (ignoring the phallic worm). Pretty good climax, and Suzume\u0026rsquo;s internal conflict over saving the lives of everyone in Tokyo vs sacrificing Souta was sufficiently tense. ROAD TRIP WOOOO I\u0026rsquo;m glad Tamaki got in the car too. I thought for a moment that Suzume and Tomoya were gonna drive off and leave Tamaki behind, which I think would\u0026rsquo;ve been both a bad message and deprive us of a lot of conflict/feelings resolution. Suzume getting told by Tomoya that the ruins of the countryside were beautiful was nice. I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for \u0026ldquo;remnants of civilization\u0026rdquo;-vibes so seeing the visual of an abandoned town overrun by greenery was cool. The songs during the road trip were great, and Tomoya\u0026rsquo;s slightly bad singing was fun. Really captured the road trip vibe and reminded me of Final Fantasy XV. The showdown in the rest area parking lot between Tamaki and Suzume was pretty generic as far as step-parent drama goes. That being said it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, so it filled its purpose of making some tension. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit dissatisfied that Tamaki\u0026rsquo;s outburst is blamed on Sadaijin\u0026rsquo;s influence, rather than purely her own emotions boiling over, but I do give props because the moment when Suzume notices Tamaki acting strange did give me a bit of a spook with Sadaijin appearing behind Tamaki to reveal what was causing the outburst. That tension gets resolved in a slightly unsatisfying way but they made up pretty realistically during the conversation on the bike so +1 for that. I\u0026rsquo;m glad they acknowledged that Tamaki did feel those feelings some of the time, rather than just saying it was all a lie. Suzume finding her old diary with all the blotted-out pages was a little unnerving. Props to that idea, felt like the stakes got raised a lil bit from that and made the deduction of where the door is a bit more interesting than simply reading the diary. The time loop thing was alright - the words of encouragement that Suzume gave her younger self were a little cliche but the moment itself was pretty heartwarming and got me hyped when I realized Suzume was the person who had given younger-Suzume the chair. Time loop stuff is always a bit dumb if you try to analyze it too far so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna just go along with my initial moment of hype and say it was cool. The final climax was a bit weak - I don\u0026rsquo;t think the music sufficiently carried the action, and I have some gripes about the keystone cats which I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about in the next section. The climax itself didn\u0026rsquo;t use the Suzume song, which was both a bit disappointing because I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to it for months and also relieving because I might\u0026rsquo;ve overplayed the Suzume song a bit too much for the song to properly hit (the slower orchestral version Closing the Door was an amazing substitute though!). As far as the actual fight goes - it was as good as it could\u0026rsquo;ve been given the enemy was a big phallic worm. This really makes me sad because I think I\u0026rsquo;d be way more into the fight if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a worm. Synchronized keystone stabbing was cool and the burning Ever After was pretty spooky. The cats were a bit weird - I think they detract from the magic a little bit. This isn\u0026rsquo;t specific to this film, but I do think Makoto Shinkai walks a really fine line with the supernatural parts of his stories. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write a deeper analysis of magic in Makoto Shinkai films later, but for now I\u0026rsquo;ll say that the sentient cats, the family line of Closers, and the passed down literature surrounding the Ever After made the magic feel too within reach. It felt like there was a mystery around the worm and the Ever After that we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to solve. Your Name and Weathering with You\u0026rsquo;s magic was a lot more abstract and less understandable, which for me makes those movie\u0026rsquo;s magical elements far more \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo;. Daijin felt a bit inconsistent in their role as a minor antagonist-turned-ally. They start off as this chaotic force that\u0026rsquo;s seemingly causing doors to open everywhere, but later on the movie tries to justify it by claiming that Daijin was leading Suzume and Souto to the open doors. If Daijin\u0026rsquo;s goal was to make sure those doors stayed closed, why did they curse Souta to limit his ability to close doors? Is it simply because Daijin took a liking to Suzume, and wanted her to be the one to close the doors? If so, the movie didn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job to make me sympathize with Daijin. Their conversations with Suzume felt entirely too taunting to turn around and go \u0026ldquo;Daijin was trying to help all along.\u0026rdquo; Next up is Sadaijin. My issue with them is that they add to the inconsistent feeling. They just show up at Souta\u0026rsquo;s grandfather\u0026rsquo;s hospital window and get told to help take care of the situation. Is that because Sadaijin is the bigger, more disciplined of the keystone deities? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t Sadaijin still be a keystone, and not in cat form? Did Daijin wake Sadaijin up from keystone duty, and if so, isn\u0026rsquo;t that a way more indefensible action for Daijin? How are they on the same side? The short of it is that the cats just felt off to me. They have all these different motives going every direction from trying to help, trying to play, trying to get in the way, and yet they\u0026rsquo;re both on the same side and also helping Suzume all along? The writing doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel consistent enough for me to sympathize with them, despite the film clearly showing Daijin being sad when they get rejected by Suzume. Overall, this was a pretty great movie. It feels distinct from Makoto Shinkai\u0026rsquo;s other works, which is relieving to see after Your Name and Weathering with You were so similar. I consider this one below Your Name but solidly above Weathering with You.

Algard is an idiot and his entire plotline was annoying. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the show did enough to show him breaking under his imposter syndrome and inferiority complex toward Anis. He turns into a rebel way too fast to take seriously. Ilia cute. Too bad the show didn\u0026rsquo;t show her backstory or anything so ends up just being a maid with overwhelming loyalty. Would\u0026rsquo;ve been cool to see what Anis did to deserve that (maybe I forgot) Lainie felt like an afterthought to shoehorn in Algard\u0026rsquo;s plan to become a vampire. I don\u0026rsquo;t see how Al would\u0026rsquo;ve known she\u0026rsquo;s a vampire to concoct this whole plan around her. The parents of Anis and Euphy were a little too understanding and chill. I respect the choice to go against the grain and do something different from \u0026ldquo;cold royal parents have high expectations and treat their kids like pawns\u0026rdquo; but Anis and Euphy\u0026rsquo;s parents were so understanding that it was hard to believe they were royalty at all. The art in the dragon fight as well as the duel in the last episode was really pretty. Especially the final duel where Euphy does her spirit contract thing. Rainbows and fairies pretty. Arc-en-ciel is a really cool and elegant looking sword. In contrast, the visuals for the Al vs Anis fight was horrendous. Too much naruto running. I also dislike the look of Anis\u0026rsquo;s dual swords overall - they look far too much like toys with their wide laser-beam looking blades. The noble party was too comically evil to take seriously. The romance was cute and fine, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel very believable. It also didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like Anis and Euphy did much together after the dragon fight. A good contrast to this is Lycoris Recoil where Chisato/Takina\u0026rsquo;s relationship felt way deeper, despite the show not actually explicitly stating any romance. Overall, first half was a 8/10 and last half was a 5/10. Comedy was far better than the drama.
